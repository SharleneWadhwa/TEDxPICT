                            together an event that prioritises the sharing of
                            ideas, stories and innovations that benefit the
                            world at large. The sharing of ideas is crucial for
                            the survival of a society that promotes progress,
                            and TEDxPICT plays its part by providing various
                            speakers a platform for the same. Encouraging free
                            thought on issues many barely speak about, shedding
                            light on hidden stories and bringing forth a surge
                            of inspiration, energy and enthusiasm is what we're
                            known for.

                            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a
                            program of local, self-organized events that bring
                            people together to share a TED-like experience. At a
                            TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers
                            combine to spark deep discussion and connection.
                            These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx,
                            where x = independently organized TED event. The TED
                            Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx
                            program, but individual TEDx events are
                            self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and
                            regulations.)

                            TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas
                            Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in
                            California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support
                            its mission with multiple initiatives. The two
                            annual TED Conferences invite the world’s leading
                            thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less.
                            Many of these talks are then made available, free,
                            at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates,
                            Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard
                            Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi
                            Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman. The
                            annual TED Conference takes place each spring in
                            Vancouver, British Columbia. TED’s media initiatives
                            include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted
                            daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides
                            subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as
                            translations from volunteers worldwide; the
                            educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established
                            the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals
                            with a wish to change the world get help translating
                            their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports
                            individuals or groups in hosting local, self-
                            organized TED-style events around the world, and the
                            TED Fellows program, helping world-changing
                            innovators from around the globe to amplify the
                            impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
