							The toughest of problems that plague the world are

							these ills. It takes real determination to become a
							youth activist for a cause. What does a youth
							activist do, however? Aakash Shah shares his

							gives us a different take on how we can create a
							positive impact in society. Aakash is a 23 year old
							Human Rights Activist and chairman of Action for
							Pune Development, a youth organization based in
							Pune. He is one of the very few youth advocates to
							have attended the official session of the 35th Human
							Rights Council in Geneva. His activism proves that
							no problem is too large for us to overcome as a
							society and as a united front.

						<h2 class="speaker1">TURNING PLASTIC BACK TO FUEL</h2>
						<p class="speaker_info">
							A world without plastic is unimaginable, even if we
							know the adverse effects it can have on our own
							health, and on the environment in general. Plastic
							is non-biodegradable, which made it rather difficult
							to dispose of - until now. Dr. Medha Tadpatrikar has
							shown us a fantastic innovation that allows us to
							recover plastic by converting it to fuel. Witnessing
							the death of deer due to plastic ingestion was the
							catalyst for Medha to begin working on waste plastic
							and segregation at source. Under her leadership, the
							Keshav Sita trust collects waste plastic. Till date,
							more than 200 metric tonnes of plastic has been
							collected and saved from the landfill. She is also
							instrumental in developing the technology that
							recovers usable fuel from waste plastic. Sustainable
							technologies are expensive, but Dr. Medha has shown
							that with enough dedication, one can innovate and
							figure out easier and more cost-effective ways of
							reducing the burden on this planet of ours.

						<p class="speaker_info2">
							What does it take to create tunes so mesmerizing and
							enthralling, that you get millions feeling euphoric?
							Ritviz, Pune's own homegrown talent has it figured
							out. He started dabbling in music since the age of
							10. Now, Ritviz is a music composer, producer,
							songwriter, singer and rapper all packed into one.
							He kickstarted his journey in July 2003 with his
							debut EP titled "Vizdumb". With bangers like Udd
							Gaye and Jeet to his name, and his debut album Ved
							coming out this year, a lot can be said about the
							meteoric rise of this young musical genius. His
							signature style of heavy bass fused with classical
							Hindustani musical influences calls for a unique and
							mesmerizing experience, bringing to us waves of
							nostalgia but also having us tapping our feet and
							hearts to the beats. His journey so far speaks
							volumes about imbibing your passion into you from an
							early age, so much so that it comes naturally to you
							after a while, as if drawn from the very depths of
							the soul.
